Digital fabrication has become more and more popular over the past few years. Today it's not hard to find affordable equipment or places with machinery available to rent by the hour. Because of that we can find a lot of interesting things that were 3D printed, laser cut or even done by the use a CNC machine.
These technologies have made it simpler to construct normal things such as furniture but also allowed a lot of experimentation into making fun objects used in a day-to-day basis.
Below are a few exemples:

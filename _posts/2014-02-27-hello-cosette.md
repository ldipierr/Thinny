Technology is everywhere, there is no denying it. We can find high tech products in almost every area we can think of, and it seems they are here to stay.

We rely on technology on a daily basis, we use it to check the weather, traffic conditions, to get to places, communicate and so on so forth. There is one thing that hadnâ€™t been upgraded so far: our clothes.

All that could change starting now. A lot of designers are starting to think of the future of fashion and as well as many other areas it seems to be filled with new thing due to the growing technology.

Digital fabrication is being applied to both the making of clothes and to its usage, meaning we can now see many conceptual outfits using 3D print technology and also laser cuter machines, as well as finding ideas on how to improve wearable items to our daily activities.

# Inovation with Digital Fabrication.

In the last post it was shown that it is possible to use digital fabrication methods to change some structure properties, as the rigidity of the material. So, if its possible to change structures used in furnitures or objects we can also assume that it is possible to apply it in a bigger scale. Flexible structures can be very useful in the architecture field, allowing the creation of new forms and the exploration of innovative concepts.

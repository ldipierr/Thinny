Light and shadow are important elements in Architecture, they can change how people feel or perceive a building or room. 
These elements have been used since quite early, specially in the East. 

Now these effects are very popular and thanks to laser cutting and CNC machines, you can find light effects of all sorts, from the simplest, such as in light fixtures to the greatest scales, in huge buildings.
